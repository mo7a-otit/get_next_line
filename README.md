# get_next_line

The get_next_line project is designed to program a function that reads and returns a line from a file descriptor. This function allows you to read a file line by line, providing a flexible and efficient way to process file content.

## Project Description

The main objectives of the get_next_line project include:
- Implementing the `get_next_line` function in C, which reads and returns a line from a file descriptor.
- Handling various edge cases and scenarios, such as reading from multiple file descriptors simultaneously or handling large file sizes.
- Managing memory allocation appropriately to prevent leaks and optimize performance.
- Enhancing your understanding of file I/O operations and handling file content efficiently.
